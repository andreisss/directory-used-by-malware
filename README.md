# directory-used-by-malware

We have a string of directories under this category that is used by applications to store user-specific data. 
Some of these folders, like AppData and Roaming, are used by malware to copy themselves into these folders and execute them from these folders.

The following lists some of the folders where <user> is your user login account name.
  
•••My Documents C:\Users\<user>\Documents
  
•••Desktop C:\Users\<user>\Desktop
  
•••AppData C:\Users\<user>\AppData
  
•••Roaming C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming

  
  Some of these paths like the AppData and Roaming are hidden by Windows and are
not visible unless you enable the option to show hidden files and folders as described in
the “Show Hidden Files and Folders”

  
  
From a malware analysis perspective, if you see a process
that has one of the names that match any of the OS system programs or more, verify the
path of the program to make sure it is located in the directory C:\Windows\system32. If
it is any other directory, most likely, the process is malicious, masquerading itself as a system process.
