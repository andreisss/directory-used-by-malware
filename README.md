# directory-used-by-malware

We have a string of directories under this category that is used by applications to store user-specific data. 
Some of these folders, like AppData and Roaming, are used by malware to copy themselves into these folders and execute them from these folders.

The following lists some of the folders where <user> is your user login account name.
  
•••My Documents C:\Users\<user>\Documents
  
•••Desktop C:\Users\<user>\Desktop
  
•••AppData C:\Users\<user>\AppData
  
•••Roaming C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming

  
  Some of these paths like the AppData and Roaming are hidden by Windows and are
not visible unless you enable the option to show hidden files and folders as described in
the “Show Hidden Files and Folders”
